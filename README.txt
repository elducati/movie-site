Technical Specifications
Design
The site has been designed in blue, purple , a few neon colors and white to bring out an esthetic cool and relaxed feeling. The choice of the colors was driven by the ability to attract the users’ attention to the details.
Carousels have been employed to draw users’ attention to movie posters, trailers and event details.  
Technical 
The site has been developed using the Material Design Bootstrap 4 which has the different carousels displayed on the website. At the top is the trailer slider with what seems to be a dual screen to enhance a user’s experience.
To increase load time, the site has been single paged. This also contributes to ease of navigation as compared to a multi page site.
